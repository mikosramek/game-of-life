        <h2>How to Play:</h2>
        <p>Use your mouse to click a square - this will add or remove life. Grey means there isn't life, red means there is.</p>
        <p>Once you're satisfied with your life arrangements, hit the Play button to see what happens.</p>
        <p>Whether life will flourish or die is based on 4 rules:</p>
        <h3>For each space that has life:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.</li>
          <li>Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
          <li>Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>For each space that has no life:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.</li>
        </ol>
